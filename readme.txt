Lightweight and fast social sharing plugin.

== Description ==

The Social Shark plugin from <a href="https://wildshark.co.uk">WildShark</a> is a lightweight, simple social sharing plugin. It utilises asynchronous loading, so it won’t slow your site down, but it still offers powerful features. Enable your site visitors to share your content on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest, customise the placement of the buttons on posts and pages, and enable the floating sidebar.

Lightweight Plugin – Social Shark is a quick and easy plugin. Once installed, you can include attractive social sharing buttons within a matter of minutes and in just a few clicks.

Responsive Design – The plugin has a responsive design. It will display effectively on mobile devices, tablet screens, and on PC and computer monitors.

Attractive Design – The buttons are lightweight but still attractive. The animated hover design provides feedback to users so that they know the plugin is responding. 

Customise Social Button Placement – Quickly add social sharing buttons to posts AND pages. Decide whether you want the buttons at the top or bottom of the post, or opt for a floating sidebar for a modern and unobtrusive look.
